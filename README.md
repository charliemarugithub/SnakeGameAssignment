To run this program, simply build and run the program. The game will start immediately. 
  
Additional features only include keeping score of the number of apples eaten and also displaying the 'Game Over' title with the final score that was achieved by the player. 
I did try and implement a Menu screen, but had one issue that I couldn't rectify in order to get it work correctly, so it was ddecided not to go ahead with the menu. 
I also tried to add music to the game but that failed as well. Following tutorials online, I could only get so far before coming up against an issue I couldn't fix, despite researching ideas on how to fix the issue. 
Therefore I have only the bear score and end game title in my game
